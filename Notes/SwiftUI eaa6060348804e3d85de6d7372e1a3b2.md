    ML & SwiftUI Example

SwiftUI is a framework that reduce the complexity of building UIs in iOS.

You define your UI by creating views, these views are managable components that you can re use to build complex hierarchies, declaratively.

# The View Protocol

Open a new Xcode Project and go directly to the `ContentView.swift file`

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Text("Hello, World!")
    }
}

struct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        ContentView()
    }
}
```

You can see now that ContentView is a struct, and its being subscribed to the View protocol.

As you can see the body property is an associatedtype, so as long as there is a single element this is fine. Since the View Protocol uses an associated type under the hood, without specifying the some keyword, you are actually returning a Protocol, with only a generic constraint, not a concrete type.

The some keyword returns an opaque type which allows it to act as if it really were a concrete type.

[Here you can find more information on using associated types with protocols](https://www.raywenderlich.com/1940187-advanced-swift-generics-and-protocols).

```swift
public protocol View {

    /// The type of view representing the body of this view.
    ///
    /// When you create a custom view, Swift infers this type from your
    /// implementation of the required `body` property.
    associatedtype Body : View

    /// Declares the content and behavior of this view.
    var body: Self.Body { get }
}
```

Go ahead and change the Content View to be an specific `Text` type.

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: Text {
        Text("Hello, World!")
    }
}
```

This is going to work fine, but this will keep you limited when you want to add another types, such as images

![SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-08_at_4.23.26_PM.png](SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-08_at_4.23.26_PM.png)

When using the `var body: some View` we can then use another type, like an image:

![SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-08_at_4.33.21_PM.png](SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-08_at_4.33.21_PM.png)

## Stacks

**Each view should have exactly one root view**, but if you could only have one component in each View struct, that wouldn't make for a very exciting UI. You notice that if you add another component, you get an error because you've given the body more than one root child view.

![SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-08_at_4.36.35_PM.png](SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-08_at_4.36.35_PM.png)

For working with multiple components vithing the view hierarchy you'll need another swiftUI component, the Stack. By wrapping your components with a VStack, you'll see that the error is gone.

The stack relies on Generic Types, and combining that with the opaque return type of Views, allows for an almost infinite number of combinations for designing your app's UI.

![SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-08_at_4.33.45_PM.png](SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-08_at_4.33.45_PM.png)

With SwiftUI you should always favor smaller, reusable components.

Lets create a simple example:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    
    let pets = ["Catie","Laurie", "Ray", "Jessy", "Antonio"]
    var body: some View {
        List {
            ForEach(pets, id:\.self){
                Text($0)
            }
        }
    }
}

struct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        ContentView()
    }
}
```

- [Notice the use of ForEach](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/quick-start/swiftui/how-to-create-views-in-a-loop-using-foreach)

![SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-08_at_4.45.27_PM.png](SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-08_at_4.45.27_PM.png)

Here is another example using an HStack

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    
    let pets = ["Catie","Laurie", "Ray", "Jessy", "Antonio"]
    var body: some View {
        ScrollView{
            HStack{
                ForEach(pets, id: \.self){pet in
                    Image(pet)
                    .resizable()
                        .aspectRatio(contentMode: .fill)
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

![SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-08_at_4.50.51_PM.png](SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-08_at_4.50.51_PM.png)

# Live Update, Modifiers & The Text Component

Example of modifiers

- .foregroundColor
- .background
- .font
- .padding

 In this example we will explore the modifiers acting on a TextView:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    
    let pets = ["Catie","Laurie", "Ray", "Jessy", "Antonio"]
    var body: some View {
        Text("Lorem Ipsum Lorem Ipsum Lorem Ipsum Lorem Ipsum Lorem Ipsum Lorem Ipsum Lorem Ipsum Lorem Ipsum Lorem Ipsum Lorem Ipsum Lorem Ipsum Lorem Ipsum Lorem Ipsum ")
            .foregroundColor(Color.red)
            .lineLimit(nil)
            .minimumScaleFactor(0.5)
            .multilineTextAlignment(.center)
            .truncationMode(.middle)
            .padding()
            .background(Color.gray)
            .border(Color.black, width: 3)
    }
}

struct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        ContentView()
    }
}
```

![SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-08_at_5.53.19_PM.png](SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-08_at_5.53.19_PM.png)

You notice that you added the Text modifiers after the foreground Color modifier on the component. Let's take a closer look as to why you did it this way. 

In the documentation you can see that the foreground color modifier is an extension to Text itself, and it returns a new text view with the styling applied

![SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-08_at_5.59.03_PM.png](SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-08_at_5.59.03_PM.png)

However if you look at truncation mode, multiTextAlignment or even lineLimit, these are actually modifers that extend View, and since View is more generic than Text from time to time you may need to apply modifers that are more specifically related to the View you want to alter in the correct order

![SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-08_at_6.04.00_PM.png](SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-08_at_6.04.00_PM.png)

SwiftUI has also support for Dynamic type where users can request that applications respect their preference for a smaller o larger font. If you are unsure about dynamic types you can check it here:

![SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-08_at_6.06.42_PM.png](SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-08_at_6.06.42_PM.png)

[Dynamic Type](https://www.raywenderlich.com/5525-dynamic-type)

SwiftUI also gives us access to primary and secondary colors which are system colors supporting both standard and Dark mode

![SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-08_at_6.07.11_PM.png](SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-08_at_6.07.11_PM.png)

To activate the Dark mode, build and run the app and select the new Environment Overrides button:

![SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-08_at_6.10.10_PM.png](SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-08_at_6.10.10_PM.png)

You can see how when using the `.primary` color and selecting the Dark mode, the letters automatically adapt to the dark mode.

![SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-08_at_6.11.56_PM.png](SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-08_at_6.11.56_PM.png)

You can also use a custom design when assigning the fonts:

![SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-08_at_6.15.14_PM.png](SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-08_at_6.15.14_PM.png)

![SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-08_at_6.17.30_PM.png](SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-08_at_6.17.30_PM.png)

You can also preview the effect  of Dynamic Type using the Canvas. Add the following code to the Preview:

```swift
struct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        Group {
            ContentView()
                .environment(\.colorScheme, .dark)
            ContentView()
                .environment(\.sizeCategory,.accessibilityExtraExtraLarge)
                
        }
    }
}
```

![SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-08_at_6.30.05_PM.png](SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-08_at_6.30.05_PM.png)

Finally getting started with custom fonts is super simple. Just make sure to import your font and set its target as the app you're trying to build or it won't be included in the bundle. Add the following code.

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    
    let pets = ["Catie","Laurie", "Ray", "Jessy", "Antonio"]
    var body: some View {
        Text("Lorem Ipsum Lorem Ipsum Lorem Ipsum Lorem Ipsum Lorem Ipsum Lorem Ipsum Lorem Ipsum Lorem Ipsum Lorem Ipsum Lorem Ipsum Lorem Ipsum Lorem Ipsum Lorem Ipsum ")
            **.font(.custom("Menlo Regular", size: 16))**
            .foregroundColor(.primary)
            .lineLimit(nil)
            .minimumScaleFactor(0.5)
            .multilineTextAlignment(.center)
            .truncationMode(.middle)
            .padding()
            .background(Color.gray)
            .border(Color.black, width: 3)
    }
}
```

![SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-08_at_6.33.12_PM.png](SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-08_at_6.33.12_PM.png)

# Images

First thing to say about SwiftUI image component is that, by default, they appear at they native size. This means that if you have a huge image file in terms of pixels,  it is going to take a lot of room. Likewise, if your image is too small, it will appear appropiately  scaled at its native size. This is to cut down on scaling artifacts when rendering images. Thankfully, when you do want to scale your images, swiftUI comes with an excellent scaling tools that make working with getting the right size a breeze. In order to resize an image in any way you'll need the **`resizable` modifer**. 

## The resizable modifier

This alllows you to resize an image and no longer respect its default content size. Looking at the documentation, you can provide insets as well a **resizing mode** which defaults to stretch**,** but you can also specified the new `tile` method, which reproduces a cool repeating  tile effect. The default `stretch` method simply scales the image's size to fill the view that it's in, but it does not respect the image's aspect ratio.  This means you can get warp results, which may not be what you want. 

![SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-09_at_9.52.20_AM.png](SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-09_at_9.52.20_AM.png)

Lets take a look on an example:

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct ImageContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
                    
            Image("Ray")
            .resizable()
                .aspectRatio(contentMode: .fit)                        
        }
    }
}

#if DEBUG

struct ImageContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        Group {
            ImageContentView()
                .previewDevice("iPhone Xs Max")
            ImageContentView()
            .previewDevice("iPhone SE")
        }
    }
}
#endif
```

![SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-09_at_11.10.15_AM.png](SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-09_at_11.10.15_AM.png)

On the custom aspect ratio, you could also add your own metrics. And you can have some Scaling ShortHands for the scaling modifier

![SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-09_at_11.11.03_AM.png](SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-09_at_11.11.03_AM.png)

## Clipping

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct ImageContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
                    
            Image("Ray")
            .resizable()
            .scaledToFit()
            .clipShape(Circle())
            .padding([.leading, .trailing])
            
            Spacer()
            Image("Catie")
            .resizable()
            .scaledToFit()
            **.mask(Image("mascot_swifty-superhero-blue").resizable())**
                .padding([.horizontal])
            
        }
    }
}
```

Xcode also provides a space for you to use on previews, the assets you locate here will be only available on the previews and will not ship with the rest of the code in the production bundle. This is great if you want to test UIs with different kinds of assets, but don't actually want to release unused content, taking up space in user devices.

            Button(action: foodPrinter) {
                VStack{
                    Image("creature-cat-purple-cute")
                    .renderingMode(.original)
                    .resizable()

                    Text("Feed Cat")
                }
            }

    }
}

We are now dealing with value types instead of reference types

![SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-09_at_12.35.45_PM.png](SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-09_at_12.35.45_PM.png)

# State

# Container Views

The container views of SwiftUI are named Stacks. 

![SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-10_at_1.16.01_PM.png](SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-10_at_1.16.01_PM.png)

## VStack

When creating stacks you can specify:

- Alignment

    ![SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-10_at_1.18.49_PM.png](SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-10_at_1.18.49_PM.png)

- spacing

    ![SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-10_at_1.19.27_PM.png](SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-10_at_1.19.27_PM.png)

- Content

![SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-10_at_1.18.08_PM.png](SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-10_at_1.18.08_PM.png)

## HStacks

Alignment

![SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-10_at_1.20.29_PM.png](SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-10_at_1.20.29_PM.png)

SwiftUI provides you with firstTextBaseline alignment when you want to align text across the first line that matches across your text components

![SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-10_at_1.22.29_PM.png](SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-10_at_1.22.29_PM.png)

Similary, if you wanted to align  your views right across the last space  line of your text , you should use .lastTextBaseAlignment  which will align the text along the bottom common lines across Text components 

![SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-10_at_1.24.00_PM.png](SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-10_at_1.24.00_PM.png)

## ZStack

This stack allows you to stack components along the Z axis or on top of one another. It is very useful if you want to layer an interface with elements overlaying  those on top of each other, also creating interesting effects.

SwiftUI layers views in the same order you add them inside the Function Builder closure **From** **Top to Bottom**

![SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-10_at_1.25.01_PM.png](SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-10_at_1.25.01_PM.png)

# Layout System

- The text components never take up any more room than they need. The Content View always assumes the size of its child,  in this case the text component. And the root view, simply places it in the middle  at the end of the layout process

![SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-13_at_9.49.25_AM.png](SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-13_at_9.49.25_AM.png)

## The 3 step layout process (Conversation between parent and child)

1. Size Proposal
    - Containing View proposes size to child
2. Size Claim Responses
    - Children reply with claimed size
3. Child Centered
    - Parent centres child in coordinate space

## Modified Views

![SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-13_at_9.54.54_AM.png](SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-13_at_9.54.54_AM.png)

- Adding modifiers to our view (for example the padding modifier), returns a new view
- However, some modifiers actually wrap your views when they applied, changing the actual type.
- You also saw, that there are times when modifiying these views changes the type of wrapper, meaning, you can't apply text specific modifiers anymore.

For example, adding a background modifier will follow this path: It will wrap both padded textview and a separate view with a solid color as a child. A padding modifier will alter its view size, but like content views, background views are very neutral when it comes to prefering the layour size. So lets look at this example, how the layout system will work work with modifers

![SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-13_at_10.02.54_AM.png](SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-13_at_10.02.54_AM.png)

1. First the root view will propose a size to the background, which will be the entired screen size:

    ![SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-13_at_10.05.59_AM.png](SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-13_at_10.05.59_AM.png)

2. The background has no interest in size, so it will pass the proposal to the padding. The padding knows how much space it needs as adaptive spacing  is in effect, let's say its 20 points  on all sides.

    ![SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-13_at_10.07.20_AM.png](SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-13_at_10.07.20_AM.png)

3. It will substract the padding size from the previously proposed size, and pass the slightly smaller size proposal down to the text component.

4. The text component only needs a small amount of space, so it claims only that amount and reports that back to the padding component.

![SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-13_at_10.09.39_AM.png](SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-13_at_10.09.39_AM.png)

![SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-13_at_10.10.01_AM.png](SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-13_at_10.10.01_AM.png)

5. The padding components remembers how much it needed from earlier on and it adds that back on and will report that now to the background component 

![SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-13_at_10.11.05_AM.png](SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-13_at_10.11.05_AM.png)

6. Here there's another child that will next be offered this size in case it wants to altered in some way, which it doesn't as it's layout neutral. This size is then reported up to the content view, and that view is then placed in the center:

![SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-13_at_10.13.03_AM.png](SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-13_at_10.13.03_AM.png)

## Stacks and the Layout System

The first principle to understand is that **components have varying degrees of flexibility when it comes to sizing.**

For example, image views render at its native content size by default, meaning the offer the least amount of flexibility.

In a situation where you have text compiting againts image inside of a stack, the image would get the maximum amount of space required as it the least flexible child, wheare as the Text can truncate its content to make it more flexible.

![SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-13_at_10.30.59_AM.png](SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-13_at_10.30.59_AM.png)

In this example the cat image is too big, 919 by 482 pixels. The root view proposed the full size of the stack. It won't substract spacing as it only has one child, so will instead pass the full size proposal to the child. The image size is huge, so it will inform the parent that requires much more than it can give, passes its size back up to the root view which will oblige, even though it knows full well that this won't fit in the screen, but will center it anyway as best it can.

If the image component is resizable, you are notifying the image that it should resize to fit the proposed size , so the image will accept pretty much whatever size it's given to work with.

![SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-13_at_10.35.10_AM.png](SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-13_at_10.35.10_AM.png)

But what happens when you add another child, for example a text component

![SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-13_at_10.39.56_AM.png](SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-13_at_10.39.56_AM.png)

As usual, the entire safe area is proposed to the stack. This times there are 2 views, so the stack will substract the padding it needs And will divide the remaning spaces evenly in two. Then it proposes that size to the least flexible child in the stack, the text component, since the image is superflexible now thanks to the resizable modifier. The text only needs a small amount of space, as it can't stretch beyond its bounds, so it reports back quite a bit of empty space.

The stack then proposes the total combined remaining space to the image, which of course, inmediately accepts the proposal as it's modified to be resizable.

What happens when you have 3 components compiting for equal spacing inside of a Stack when there isn't enough room.

Here we have an HStack with 2 text components and 1 image. You need your users to rate your app, so  first text component is very important. It's size is set to a specific large value. Since there is not enough space something has to got to give,and looking at the output you can see that the store ratining text and the star rating text are being truncated, and the image is extremely small.

![SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-13_at_10.43.47_AM.png](SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-13_at_10.43.47_AM.png)

Remember that the resizable modifier causes the image becomes extremly flexible.

The Stack view or parent will approach to the least flexible child with a proposal, in this case, the other text components.

The stack will substract its padding and propose as much room as it can spare divided by two to the text components, which will complain and will ask for more. The stack will give them as much space as it can and thus the text will be truncated before finallly providing the left over size to the image, which will accept.

You can increase the layout priority for the views you really don't want to compromise, this will making it the least flexible. This increase it from the default value of zero, and will mean that the text will be rendered at full size, meaning there is less space proposed to the other views

![SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-13_at_10.49.18_AM.png](SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-13_at_10.49.18_AM.png)

If you provide no-fall-back modifier such as a minimum scale factor on the text, it will truncate. If you add in a minimum scale factor before the font end modifier, the text  is modified to shrink to 40% of its specified size of 30 points

![SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-13_at_10.53.13_AM.png](SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-13_at_10.53.13_AM.png)

You can also add a layout priority of one to the second text component, the one with the stars. Now you star rating has shrunk to 40% of its font size and you've force the stars to take up more room leaving a tiny amount of space offered to the image at the end, which you can barely see thanks to its resizable modifer.

![SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-13_at_10.54.50_AM.png](SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-13_at_10.54.50_AM.png)

Removing the scale to fit modifier and replacing it with an aspect ratio  of one to one and fixed width and fixed, will make the width and height the same . Now the least flexible children are the stars and the image, so the text will try and shrink to 40% of its size before truncating.

![SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-13_at_10.57.16_AM.png](SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-13_at_10.57.16_AM.png)

## The Frame Modifier

Let's discusse the frame modifer.  If you specify a widht and a height explicitly for a view, you are providing a non negotiable size for it, which the parent will have to respect, if you only provide one explicit dimension the resulting view will assume its parent size in the ommited direction. Like in the example below, we omit the width, so it takes the width of the parent view.

![SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-13_at_11.01.31_AM.png](SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-13_at_11.01.31_AM.png)

Something similar will occur if we only specify the width:

![SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-13_at_11.03.33_AM.png](SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-13_at_11.03.33_AM.png)

In the case of labels, you might specify that it also has a fixed frame, altough that probably isn't a good idea, there is nothing to stop the child of creating a non-negotiable frame for its content

![SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-13_at_11.03.50_AM.png](SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-13_at_11.03.50_AM.png)

In this case where the bounds are bigger than the view's actual content you can specify  an aligment for the frame just like stack views 

![SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-13_at_11.05.10_AM.png](SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-13_at_11.05.10_AM.png)

Finally if you don't want to specific set a frame and allow to grow and shrink to fil its parent view, you have a flexible frame where you can specify minimum and maximun sizes. If you wanted to shrink and grow completely you can pass in nil for the minimun size  and infinity for the maximun size.

![SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-13_at_11.06.34_AM.png](SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-13_at_11.06.34_AM.png)

# KeyPaths

They allow you to access a property  of an object itself without accessing its actual value. This means that you don't have to explicitly evaluate what instance of a model you might have in a collection, just a generic reference to one of its properties.

![SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-13_at_1.49.45_PM.png](SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-13_at_1.49.45_PM.png)

For example

![SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-13_at_1.52.18_PM.png](SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-13_at_1.52.18_PM.png)

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    let tips = ["Dream of mice", "Make some origami", "Get the dog juggling"]
    var body: some View {
        VStack{
            ForEach(Range(0...3)){
                Text("Cat relaxation tip numbre:\($0)")
            }
        }
    }
}
```

![SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-13_at_1.56.22_PM.png](SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-13_at_1.56.22_PM.png)

Now lets use the `ForEach` method to iterate over our `tips` array:

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView01: View {
    let tips = ["Dream of mice", "Make some origami", "Get the dog juggling"]
    var body: some View {
        VStack{
            ForEach(self.tips, id: \.self){ tip in
                VStack{
                    Image("meditate")
                        .resizable()
                        .scaledToFit()
                    Text("Cat relaxation tip numbre:\(tip)")
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

![SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-13_at_2.03.25_PM.png](SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-13_at_2.03.25_PM.png)

What about more complex models. For more complex types you will need to provide a way of making sure the identifiable value is unique.  There are 2 options

- You provide a way to uniquely identify your model using a KeyPath
- You make the model 'identifiable' by conforming to the Identifiable protocol.

# List and Forms

# GeometryReader

## The problem geometry reader resolves

Avoids the need to use hardcode frames: You've been in the situation when you need a CGSize or CGPoint to set or fill an element in the screen, but this may be subject of change due the different screen sizes or when users luanch 2 windows on iPad. The Geometry readers gives you a proxy object, which contains all the geometry measures you need and you can be sure this metrics are valid no matter the device you are in.

Often when working with scroll views, you want to know the exact size of the device you are working with, imaging the case where you need to create a view that is half of the width  of the Content View, as example. Here the Geometry Reader comes in handy.

A geometry reader will return the size of the container view inside its own coordinate space, it returns  this in the form of a proxy object which is like an accesor to the size and coordinate space of the container view itself. Think of if like a parent deciding what the child should do rather that the child telling to the parent what to do when you absolutely need that control.

![SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-14_at_9.30.48_AM.png](SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-14_at_9.30.48_AM.png)

![SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-14_at_9.36.20_AM.png](SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-14_at_9.36.20_AM.png)

When you return a geometry reader, it is acting like a container view wrapped around your components, providing handy information about the overall size you'll be working with.

It's important to note that you could just simply use UIScreen bounds property but that isn't relayable when multiple windows are open at once.

Working with Geometry Reader ensures the view will be re-rendered if another window is open for multitasking. 

The proxy object itselfs gives you a CGSize, which is great for most of the time, however it also gives you access to ContentView's Frame  inside both local and global coordinate spaces.

The global coordinate space is the frame is respect to the Content View's layout independent of the view the proxy is in.

# TabView

# Biding Data

Views are functions of their state, and data is now a first class citizen.

![SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-14_at_1.21.25_PM.png](SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-14_at_1.21.25_PM.png)

## @State   &    @Binding

![SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-15_at_10.02.39_AM.png](SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-15_at_10.02.39_AM.png)

There is a key difference betweent the imperative and declarative programming paradigms. With imperative programming (UIKit) you needed to manually update your view when the data was updated. With declarative programming (SwiftUI) a single event starts a chain of reactions which end up with the View being updated, in other words, UI is automatically updated.

In UIKit you usually don't have the freedom to use initializers to inject dependencies because objects  like UIView and UIViewController were created for you by UIKit itself. With SwiftUI instead you have full control over initializers, so you can inject data into an instance at the same time it's initialized.  This is great, remember how you use to work injecting dependencies to UIViewControllers, by using some Method Injection from the DependencyRegister.

```swift
class LoginViewController: UIViewController {
	    var webView: WKWebView!
	    var router:RouterCoordinator?
	    var loginPresenter: LoginPresenterProtocol?

		 //METHOD INJECTION <---- Not anymore with SwiftUI
	   func config(router:RouterCoordinator, loginPresenter:LoginPresenterProtocol){
        self.router = router
        self.loginPresenter = loginPresenter       
	    }
}
```

Having control of initializers comes in handy, there are 3 types of usages in SwiftUI: Static Dependencies, State and Bindings.

## Static Dependencies

![SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-15_at_10.16.36_AM.png](SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-15_at_10.16.36_AM.png)

Lets take this BookDetailView as example. It conforms to the View protocols, which means that it should know how to calculate its own body.

When you add a book property, the memeberwise initialiser was automatically generated to enforce that dependency, as part of the initialization process. This is something you should be familiar with and it really enforces the idea of knowing all dependencies upfront.

Adding a dependency on a View this way is great for static data providing convenient, read-only access , meaning it's value cannot change. For a master detail model that's work fine. You are simply passing a model over to the detail view. However, what happens when you need to respond to data changes and reflect that in the UI when the struct properties are inmutable? For this you need a way of setting aside a View's state as a mutable type in memory that, when triggered will re-render the View. This is where states comes in...

## State

![SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-15_at_10.23.48_AM.png](SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-15_at_10.23.48_AM.png)

When you add a `State` attribute to a View property, that property is automatically set aside in memory as mutable type that has an actual binding to the view itself if you are interested, the state attribute is a property wrapper which adds functionality to the property you created and was introduced as part of swift 5. 

### The State is the single source of truth.

This means that each Containing View can only have a single source of truth. By using state, you are defining a section of memory where the UI should look for updates, this is the place where the data will be initialized and located. By having a parent view with some state and creating a child component with state being passed into the child would invalidate this principle. 

![SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-15_at_10.27.03_AM.png](SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-15_at_10.27.03_AM.png)

### All State should be private and accesible by the containint view only

![SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-15_at_10.31.50_AM.png](SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-15_at_10.31.50_AM.png)

You don't want parents to mutate its child's state as this could cause unwanted side effects.  By adopting this encapsulation of data SwiftUI enforces the use of smaller, reusable components with dependencies of data further showing redundancy of ViewControllers.

There is still the problem of passing data through a chain of View Hierarchy.  With State, when you pass a value into an initializer for a View, you are literally passing in a copy of the model as a dependency. You need a mechanism to pass data between Views without  interfeering with principles of Scope and Single source of truth.

Here we introduce the use of bindings

## Bindings

![SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-15_at_10.41.26_AM.png](SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-15_at_10.41.26_AM.png)

You can think of bindings as objects that contains data and then can trigger automatic UI updates when their state changes.

With bindings you want to pass the in the mechanism to connect directly with some data, rather than the data itself. When passing in a binding to a value this way, SwiftUI utilizes the dollar sign syntax before a bindable value to indicate that you want to pass in the binding rather than the value.

In this case is fine to mark the state property as private in the view itself as you are passing the state as a direct binding and the source of truth is single and clear. In reality you may have a piece of state that's located way up to the view hierarchy, so how we can pass this down without adding more state dependencies to the child views?.

![SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-15_at_10.44.25_AM.png](SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-15_at_10.44.25_AM.png)

For this you simple create a depedency the binding property wrapper in the child. This indicates that there is a binding property as a dependency in the child view, but that the source of truth is located elsewhere, meaning that the child doesn't actually own it. This appears in the child memberwise initializer just like any other dependent property exactly as you are used to.

as analogy,     @State and @Binding are similar to the difference between value and reference types. @State is like value type, because it holds the data, whereas  binding is like a reference type because the data is stored elsewhere.

# Working with custom models

Often you will need a custom model that mutates  a value type, and have dependent Views that rely on it. What you really want is something to be triggered such as a network call example, which would then mutate the model.

![SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-15_at_12.07.48_PM.png](SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-15_at_12.07.48_PM.png)

Any views dependent of that model would then be re-rendered to reflect a new state. For this you need a  custom reference-type model to conform to observable object. By conforming to the observable object protocol, your model provides a mechanism to bind and entire object and its properties to a view. It's ideal for data that you control and for external models that need to be passed into hierarchy. SwiftUI knows when to trigger a re-render of a View, which dependes of your own custom model by utilizing the `objectWillChange` property, which is the only requirement of the ObservableObject. This utilizes part of the combine framework

![SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-15_at_12.12.33_PM.png](SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-15_at_12.12.33_PM.png)

For now, you need to know that you don't need to implement that property, if you want to re-render views when a property value changes make sure you annotate that property with the Published attribute, which instructs the compiler to automatically synthesize the code neccesary to observe it and propagate its changes to its subscribers. By using the Publish attribute you get to decide which properties of your model should send notification to views  that are subscribers. This will cause a notification to be sent to Views subscribed to the data model reference type whenever their value changes, trigering a re-rendering as a result. 

Once your model is ready, you can add it as dependency to your view by using the `ObservedObject` attribute to indicate to SwiftUI that the data is external and a reference type and it should subscribe for changes in the mode that can be published at any time.

Looking at the initializer, you can see that it takes the object as a simple parameter just like before. 

![SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-15_at_12.19.07_PM.png](SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-15_at_12.19.07_PM.png)

What if you have a model that lots of parts of your application dependes on, such as your user model?. Rather than passing the model deeply throught many initializers, you can pass it via the Environment itself as an EnvironmentObject, it contains lots of useful information that can be fed through all of the views in your app. These range from colors scheme, size class,  to user font sizes, and lots more.

![SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-15_at_4.24.44_PM.png](SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-15_at_4.24.44_PM.png)

You may have some concern of this global acces, it doesn't totally right, but be sure that it complains with the principle of single source of truth for when you need acces to a model app-wide. In fact, multiple views can depend on a single model and since you don't have to manually update the model, all views that rely on it, would be re-rendered automatically avoiding nasty bugs and side effects.

![SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-15_at_4.27.23_PM.png](SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-15_at_4.27.23_PM.png)

You need to provide this object, in your case in the contentView itself which is initialized in the new SceneDelegate.

For now you simply will use the EnvironmentObject modifier and pass in an instance whose source of truth is in SceneDelegate as a simple property.

![SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-15_at_4.30.04_PM.png](SwiftUI%20eaa6060348804e3d85de6d7372e1a3b2/Screen_Shot_2020-10-15_at_4.30.04_PM.png)

Once your environment object is being passed down the app's Environment, you can easily add a dependency on your view by adding the Environment  attribute as a property. This give you access to the object, and when it mutates it will trigger a change event to notify the subscribers and efficiently re-render whats needs to be  updated. 

Looks like the SceneDelegate doesn't appear in new projects created with the new Xcode 12. But you still can add an enviroment variable when creating the main app instance.

```swift
import SwiftUI

@main
struct SwiftUI101App: App {
    
    private var user = User.exampleUser
    
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView().environmentObject(user)
        }
    }
}
```

Then, wherever you need access to this environment variable, you just need to add the `@EnvironmentObject` attribute. For example, in the content view we woudl have something like:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var isPresented = false
    @State var selectedBook: Book? = nil
    @State var books = Box(Book.demoBooks)
    
    @EnvironmentObject private var user: User
    
    var body: some View {
        NavigationView{
            ZStack {
                VStack{
										...................
```

When working with state in swiftUI there are a number of options to choose from, but one thing is consistent, there should be a single source of truth in your data. Use the state attribute when a View needs to own its own data (locally), When passing a state into a child view, use Binding to create a a dependency on a state  that is located elsewhere. When using your own models which you own and maintain, Observable objects is your best choice. Finally, for models that multiple views depend on, consider using the Environment itself to pass objects down  through your hierarchies using Environment Objects.
